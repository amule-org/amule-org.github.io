title: EC Protocol
---

The **External Connections (EC) protocol** is the binary protocol that [`amuled`](../manual/interfaces/amuled.md), [`amulegui`](../manual/interfaces/gui/amulegui.md), [`amuleweb`](../manual/interfaces/amuleweb.md), and [`amulecmd`](../manual/interfaces/amulecmd.md) use to communicate. It is a structured, efficient, and extensible binary protocol.

The protocol is defined in the aMule source under `src/libs/ec/` and `src/ExternalConn.cpp` — those files are the canonical reference if anything on this page conflicts with them.

EC packets carry data as nested, typed tags. The same tag-encoding idea (a type byte, a name, and a type-dependent value) underlies aMule's on-disk binary files; see [File Formats](file-formats/index.md) for those layouts.

:::note
EC is considered stable. Opcodes, tag names, and tag content formats can still change between releases. If you are implementing an EC client, pin the `EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION` to the version you have tested against.
:::

## Protocol Overview

EC is a two-layer protocol:

1. **Transmission layer** — an 8-byte header (4-byte flags + 4-byte packet body length) that precedes every application-layer packet.
2. **Application layer** — a tree-structured packet format with an opcode and nested tags.

All values in both layers are in **network byte order (big-endian, MSB first)**.

## Section 1 — Transmission Layer

The transmission layer header is always exactly **8 bytes**: a 4-byte flags word followed by a 4-byte packet body length, both in big-endian (network) byte order.

```
[uint32]  flags         — capability and encoding flags (big-endian)
[uint32]  body_length   — byte count of the application-layer data that follows
```

`body_length` does not include the 8-byte header itself.

### Bit Definitions

| Bit(s) | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | `EC_FLAG_ZLIB` | When set, the application-layer data is zlib-compressed. |
| `1` | `EC_FLAG_UTF8_NUMBERS` | When set, all integers in the application layer are encoded as UTF-8 wide characters (avoids zero bytes in small packets). |
| `2` | Reserved | Must be 0. |
| `3` | Reserved | Must be 0. |
| `4` | `EC_FLAG_LARGE_TAG_COUNT` | When set, `TAGCOUNT` fields use the sentinel-extended encoding (see [Section 1.2](#section-12--application-layer)). Both sides must have advertised `EC_TAG_CAN_LARGE_TAG_COUNT` in their authentication packet. |
| `5` | Always 1 | Fixed protocol marker; acts as a sanity check. |
| `6` | Always 0 | Fixed protocol marker; acts as a sanity check. |
| `7–31` | Reserved | Must be 0. |

The sender always sets bit 5 and clears bit 6. The receiver rejects any packet where `(flags & 0x60) != 0x20`.

:::note
Unlike `EC_FLAG_ZLIB` / `EC_FLAG_UTF8_NUMBERS` / `EC_FLAG_LARGE_TAG_COUNT`, the partial INC_UPDATE capability (`EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_UPDATE`, see [Section 3](#section-3--authentication)) has no transmission-layer flag bit. Once advertised by the client and echoed by the server at auth time it is active for the whole connection, with no per-packet toggle.

### Example

```
00 00 00 20  00 00 00 43  <appdata>
```

Flags = `0x00000020` (bit 5 set, no compression, no UTF-8 numbers). Body length = 67 bytes (`0x43`).

## Section 1.2 — Application Layer

The application layer consists of **packets** and **tags**.

### Packet Structure

A packet is a special root tag — it has no data of its own, no `TAGLEN` field, and always has a `TAGCOUNT` field. All numbers in the application layer are big-endian (MSB first).

```c
[ec_opcode_t]   OPCODE        // uint8: what the packet contains
[uint16]        TAGCOUNT      // number of first-level tags
<[uint32]       EXTENDED_TAGCOUNT>?  // only when EC_FLAG_LARGE_TAG_COUNT
                <tags>
```

When `EC_FLAG_LARGE_TAG_COUNT` is in effect and `TAGCOUNT == 0xFFFF`, a `uint32` follows with the actual count. This sentinel-extended encoding lifts the historical 65535-tag ceiling for large responses (e.g. a shared-file list with more than 65535 entries).

### Tag Structure

```c
[ec_tagname_t]  TAGNAME       // uint16
[ec_tagtype_t]  TAGTYPE       // uint8
[ec_taglen_t]   TAGLEN        // uint32: total tag length including sub-tags,
                              //         excluding TAGNAME/TAGTYPE/TAGLEN fields
<[uint16]       TAGCOUNT>?    // only present if the tag has sub-tags
                <sub-tags>
                <tag data>
```

- `TAGNAME` on the wire is `(actual_code << 1) | has_children`. To recover the true tag name, right-shift by 1 (`actual_code = TAGNAME >> 1`). The lowest bit signals whether a `TAGCOUNT` and sub-tags are present.
- `TAGTYPE` identifies the data type (see `ECTagTypes.h` in the source).
- `TAGLEN` includes the length of all sub-tags (plus their `TAGCOUNT` field) but excludes the header fields (`TAGNAME`, `TAGTYPE`, `TAGLEN`) themselves.
- When a tag has sub-tags, they appear **before** the tag's own data. Own data length = `TAGLEN − (sum of all sub-tag total lengths) − sizeof(TAGCOUNT)`.
- When `EC_FLAG_LARGE_TAG_COUNT` is in effect, the sub-tag `TAGCOUNT` uses the same sentinel-extended encoding as the packet-level `TAGCOUNT`.

**Example:** a tag with `TAGNAME = 0x0E03` on the wire has `has_children = 1` (bit 0 set) and true tag code = `0x0E03 >> 1 = 0x0701` = `EC_TAG_SEARCH_TYPE`.

## Section 2 — Data Types

### Integer Types

All integer types (`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`) are in network byte order (big-endian) in the application layer.

aMule encodes each integer with the **narrowest type that fits its value**: `CECTag::InitInt` (`ECTag.cpp`) picks `UINT8` for values `≤ 0xFF`, `UINT16` for `≤ 0xFFFF`, `UINT32` for `≤ 0xFFFFFFFF`, otherwise `UINT64` — regardless of the C++ width the sender used. So a field documented as `uint32` may arrive on the wire as `UINT8`, `UINT16`, or `UINT32` depending on the value. Clients **must** read integers with a width-agnostic reader (e.g. `GetInt()`) and never assume the declared width. This is why the `EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION` example below is `UINT16` even though the sender passes it as a 64-bit value.

When `EC_FLAG_UTF8_NUMBERS` is set, integers are encoded as UTF-8 wide characters to avoid zero bytes. Consumers can pass them through a UTF-8 decoder to obtain the original value.

### Strings

Strings are always **UTF-8**, including the trailing zero byte. All strings from the server are untranslated; their translations are in `amule.mo`.

### Boolean

- **When reading**: presence of the tag means `true`; absence means `false`.
- **When writing**: the tag must always be present and hold a `uint8` (0 = false, non-zero = true). If the tag is absent on write, the receiver treats it as *unchanged*.

Boolean values are primarily used for reading and writing preferences.

### MD4/MD5 Hashes

Always 16 raw bytes (byte order does not apply to the hash itself), stored with `EC_TAGTYPE_HASH16`.

### IPv4 Addresses

An IPv4 address+port is packed as 6 bytes: 4 bytes for the IP (network order) followed by 2 bytes for the port (network order).

### Floating-Point Numbers

`float` and `double` values are converted to their string representation and sent as strings. The decimal separator is always `.` (dot), regardless of locale.

## Section 3 — Authentication

Authentication is a **three-step** challenge-response exchange at the start of every session. The client identifies itself and advertises capabilities; the server issues a random salt; the client hashes the password with the salt and sends the result.

### Step 1 — Auth Request (client → server)

```
EC_OP_AUTH_REQ (0x02)
    +-- EC_TAG_CLIENT_NAME         (optional) — name of the EC client application
    +-- EC_TAG_CLIENT_VERSION      (optional) — version of the EC client application
    +-- EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION    (required) — EC protocol version (currently 0x0204)
    +-- EC_TAG_VERSION_ID          (dev builds only, must NOT appear in releases) — MD5 hash of `ECCodes.h`
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_ZLIB            (optional) — advertises zlib compression support
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_UTF8_NUMBERS    (optional) — advertises UTF-8 number encoding support
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_NOTIFY          (optional) — advertises notification support
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_LARGE_TAG_COUNT (optional) — advertises sentinel-extended tag count support
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_UPDATE  (optional) — advertises partial INC_UPDATE support
```

Each `EC_TAG_CAN_*` is an empty tag (type `CUSTOM`, zero-length data) advertising a capability. `EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH` does **not** appear in this packet.

`EC_TAG_VERSION_ID` is the **MD5** digest of `ECCodes.h` (with comments and whitespace normalised, so only real code changes alter it). It is transported in a 16-byte `HASH16` container, but the algorithm is MD5, not MD4. It is compiled in only on development builds (gated by the `EC_VERSION_ID` macro in `src/ExternalConn.cpp`) and must never appear in release builds.

### Step 2 — Salt (server → client)

```
EC_OP_AUTH_SALT (0x4F)
    +-- EC_TAG_PASSWD_SALT  (required) — uint64 random salt value
```

### Step 3 — Password (client → server)

The client computes the salted hash:

```
salt_hex   = upper-hex-string(salt_value)            // e.g. "5E3AB49C174F0C02"
salt_hash  = MD5(salt_hex)                           // hex-encoded MD5 of the hex salt
final_hash = MD5(lower(MD5(password)) + salt_hash)   // MD5 of concatenated hex strings
```

`salt_hex` is produced with a `"%lX"` format (`ExternalConn.cpp`): **uppercase** hex, **no leading-zero padding**, and **no `0x` prefix**. The salt is a full random `uint64`, so it is usually 16 hex digits, but a value whose high nibble is zero yields fewer digits — do not zero-pad to 16. `MD5(password)` is the password already stored as a lowercase MD5 hex string in aMule's preferences.

Then sends:

```
EC_OP_AUTH_PASSWD (0x50)
    +-- EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH  (required) — HASH16: 16-byte salted MD5 result above
```

### Step 4 — Server Reply

On success:

```
EC_OP_AUTH_OK (0x04)
    +-- EC_TAG_SERVER_VERSION      (always)   — aMule version string
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_LARGE_TAG_COUNT (optional) — echoed if the server accepts the feature
    +-- EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_UPDATE  (optional) — echoed if partial INC_UPDATE mode is active
```

The server echoes only the capabilities it will honour. The client must not use a capability unless the server echoed it.

On failure:

```
EC_OP_AUTH_FAIL (0x03)
    +-- EC_TAG_STRING  (optional) — human-readable reason
```

### Wire-Level Example

00 00 00 20                         FLAGS
00 00 00 12                         Body length: 18 bytes
4f                                  EC_OP_AUTH_SALT
  00 01                             Tag count: 1
    00 16                           EC_TAG_PASSWD_SALT (0x000B, no children)
      05                            EC_TAGTYPE_UINT64
      00 00 00 08                   TagLen: 8
      5e 3a b4 9c 17 4f 0c 02      salt value (example)
```

**Step 3 — Password** (client → server):

```
00 00 00 20                         FLAGS
00 00 00 1a                         Body length: 26 bytes
50                                  EC_OP_AUTH_PASSWD
  00 01                             Tag count: 1
    00 02                           EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH (0x0001, no children)
      09                            EC_TAGTYPE_HASH16

      b9 71 9d 91 10 17 c5 92
```

**Step 4 — Auth OK** (server → client):

```
00 00 00 20                         FLAGS
00 00 00 15                         Body length: 21 bytes
04                                  EC_OP_AUTH_OK
  00 02                             Tag count: 2
    0a 16                           EC_TAG_SERVER_VERSION (0x050B, no children)
      06                            EC_TAGTYPE_STRING
      00 00 00 04                   TagLen: 4
      43 56 53 00                   "CVS\0"
    00 22                           EC_TAG_CAN_LARGE_TAG_COUNT (0x0011, no children)
      01                            EC_TAGTYPE_CUSTOM
      00 00 00 00                   TagLen: 0
```

### UTF-8 Encoded Tag Names

When `EC_FLAG_UTF8_NUMBERS` is active, tag names are also encoded as UTF-8 wide characters. The value encoded is `(actual_code << 1) | has_children`. Example:

```
c8 80
```

UTF-8 decode: `c8 80` → `0x0200`. Bit 0 = 0 (no children). True code = `0x0200 >> 1 = 0x0100` = `EC_TAG_CLIENT_NAME` (0x0100 in `ECCodes.h`).

### Partial Updates (INC_UPDATE)

A client that advertises `EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_UPDATE` (0x0012) in its auth request tells the server it understands the **partial incremental-update** protocol. When the server activates this mode it echoes `EC_TAG_CAN_PARTIAL_UPDATE` in `EC_OP_AUTH_OK`.

In a partial `EC_DETAIL_INC_UPDATE` response (e.g. the download or shared-file list), the server may then **omit files that have not changed** and signal removals explicitly with an `EC_TAG_FILE_REMOVED` (0x0013) tag, instead of the legacy "absence implies deletion" convention. The feature is backward-compatible: a server talking to a client that did **not** advertise the capability (or an old server that does not implement it) falls back to emitting an alive marker for every unchanged file, so the client's bulk "missing == deleted" logic still works.

```

The 11 tags above are the minimum reply when Kademlia is *not* connected. When `Kademlia::CKademlia::IsConnected()` returns true the reply additionally contains `EC_TAG_STATS_KAD_FIREWALLED_UDP`, `KAD_INDEXED_SOURCES`, `KAD_INDEXED_KEYWORDS`, `KAD_INDEXED_NOTES`, `KAD_INDEXED_LOAD`, `KAD_IP_ADDRESS`, `KAD_IN_LAN_MODE`, `BUDDY_STATUS`, `BUDDY_IP`, and `BUDDY_PORT`.

`EC_DETAIL_FULL` and `EC_DETAIL_INC_UPDATE` additionally prepend `STATS_UP_OVERHEAD`, `STATS_DOWN_OVERHEAD`, `STATS_BANNED_COUNT`, a logger tag, `STATS_TOTAL_SENT_BYTES`, `STATS_TOTAL_RECEIVED_BYTES`, and `STATS_SHARED_FILE_COUNT`. See `Get_EC_Response_StatRequest` in `ExternalConn.cpp` for the exact assembly, and `ECCodes.h` for the full `0x0200` tag range.

### Connection State

Connection state is requested separately with `EC_OP_GET_CONNSTATE` (0x0B). The reply uses opcode `EC_OP_MISC_DATA` (0x07) and contains `EC_TAG_CONNSTATE` with the current UserID as its own data and `EC_TAG_SERVER` as a child:

```
EC_OP_GET_CONNSTATE (0x0b)
    +-- EC_TAG_DETAIL_LEVEL
```

Reply:

```
EC_OP_MISC_DATA (0x07)
    +-- EC_TAG_CONNSTATE (0x0005)  — uint32 UserID; has children when connected
        +-- EC_TAG_SERVER (0x0500) — IPv4: server IP+port; has children
            +-- EC_TAG_SERVER_NAME (0x0501) — string
```

Partial wire decoding:

              06                    EC_TAGTYPE_STRING

      90 cc 83 52                   EC_TAG_CONNSTATE data: current UserID
```

How the `TAGLEN` values arise (matching `CECTag::GetTagLen` in `ECTag.cpp`):

- `EC_TAG_SERVER_NAME`: 14 (own data) → `TAGLEN = 14`.
- `EC_TAG_SERVER`: 6 (own IPv4 data) + 7 (`SERVER_NAME` header: `TAGNAME` + `TAGTYPE` + `TAGLEN`) + 14 (`SERVER_NAME` data) → `TAGLEN = 27`. Note that `SERVER`'s own `TAGCOUNT` field is *not* counted in its own `TAGLEN` — only each sub-tag's contribution is.
- `EC_TAG_CONNSTATE`: 4 (own UserID data) + 7 (`SERVER` header) + 2 (`SERVER`'s `TAGCOUNT`, because `SERVER` has children) + 27 (`SERVER`'s `TAGLEN`) → `TAGLEN = 40`.

### Search Request

## Section 5 — Preferences Tags

### Connection Preferences (`EC_TAG_PREFS_CONNECTIONS = 0x1300`)

| Tag | Code | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EC_TAG_CONN_DL_CAP` | `0x1301` | `uint32` | Download line capacity (kB/s) |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_UL_CAP` | `0x1302` | `uint32` | Upload line capacity (kB/s) |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_DL` | `0x1303` | `uint32` | Max download speed (kB/s) |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_UL` | `0x1304` | `uint32` | Max upload speed (kB/s) |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_SLOT_ALLOCATION` | `0x1305` | `uint32` | Upload slot allocation |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_FILE_SOURCES` | `0x1309` | `uint16` | Max sources per file |
| `EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_CONN` | `0x130A` | `uint16` | Max connections |

:::note
`EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_DL`, `EC_TAG_CONN_MAX_UL`, and `EC_TAG_CONN_SLOT_ALLOCATION` were widened from `uint16` to `uint32` to support speeds above 65534 kB/s (~524 Mbps) needed on modern gigabit connections. EC clients reading these tags should use `GetInt()` (which handles any integer width); clients sending them should encode them as 32-bit values.

## Section 6 — Implementing an EC Client

EC can be used to build custom clients for aMule in any language. A minimal client needs to:

1. Open a TCP connection to [`amuled`](../manual/interfaces/amuled.md) (default port 4712 — the port, password, and whether EC is enabled at all are set in the [`[ExternalConnect]`](../manual/configuration/config-files/amule-conf.md#externalconnect-section) section of `amule.conf`).
2. Send the 8-byte transmission header followed by `EC_OP_AUTH_REQ` with `EC_TAG_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and capability tags.
3. Receive `EC_OP_AUTH_SALT` and extract the `EC_TAG_PASSWD_SALT` value (uint64).
4. Compute `final_hash = MD5(lower(MD5(password)) + MD5(upper_hex(salt)))`, where `upper_hex(salt)` is the salt formatted as **uppercase** hex with no leading-zero padding and no `0x` prefix.
5. Send `EC_OP_AUTH_PASSWD` with `EC_TAG_PASSWD_HASH` = the computed hash.
6. Receive the reply. If `EC_OP_AUTH_OK`, proceed; if `EC_OP_AUTH_FAIL`, the password was wrong or another error occurred.
7. Send request packets and receive reply packets in a request/response loop.

**Minimal flags value**: Use `0x00000020` (32-bit big-endian) as the flags word. aMule will not use any extensions if you do not advertise them.

### Reference Implementations

The canonical implementation is in the aMule source:

- `src/libs/ec/cpp/` — C++ client library (shared by `amulegui`, `amulecmd`)
- `src/ExternalConn.cpp` — server-side implementation in `amuled`
- `src/libs/ec/cpp/ECCodes.h` — all opcode and tag name constants
- `src/libs/ec/cpp/ECTagTypes.h` — tag type constants
- `src/libs/ec/cpp/ECTag.cpp` — tag wire encoding/decoding (see `WriteTag`, `ReadFromSocket`)
- `src/libs/ec/cpp/ECSocket.cpp` — transmission layer (see `WritePacket`, `ReadHeader`)

## Section 7 — Design Notes

Key design goals of the protocol:

- **Security** — salted MD5 password hashing; extensible capability negotiation.
- **Efficiency** — zlib compression for large responses; UTF-8 integer encoding for small packets.
- **Flexibility** — nested tag structure allows adding new fields without breaking existing clients.

The protocol can be modelled as binary XML, or equivalently as a tree: one root (the packet), with any number of branches (tags) and leaves (tags with no children).
